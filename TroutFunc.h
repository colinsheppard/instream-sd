// TroutFunc is placed on the list of animal
// update functions in the survival manager.
// All it does is set and return the current
// animal. It seems safer to do it this way
// because when updating/getting the survival probs,
// the survival manager can test to ensure
// that the current animal is indeed the animal
// that we want to operate on and NOT an animal
// from a previous calculation.
