===========

This repository is for Version 6.0 of inSTREAM, also known as inSTREAM-SD. 

This version updates Version 3.1, which includes hourly flows, representation of day and night habitat, and the trout behavior of deciding whether to feed or hide. The update is primarily to include the generic two-dimensional habitat depiction and graphical user interface of inSTREAM 5.0. 

Full documentation is being prepared.

This version was funded by Argonne National Laboratory under ANL contract no. 2F-32941 with Lang Railsback & Associates. 

inSTREAM 6.0 was developed from previous versions by Steven Railsback, and software development was by Colin Sheppard.
